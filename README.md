# Tree_Data_Structure

This repository contains a simple implementation of a tree data structure in C++. Trees are a fundamental data structure widely used in computer science for organizing and manipulating hierarchical data. This implementation provides a basic framework for creating, manipulating, and traversing trees.

## Introduction

A tree is a hierarchical data structure with a root element and a set of child elements. Each child element in the tree is also the root of its subtree. This repository provides a simple implementation of a tree data structure in C++.

## Features

- **Generic Implementation:** The tree structure is designed to be generic, allowing users to store any data type in the nodes.
- **Basic Operations:** The implementation supports fundamental operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal (pre-order, in-order, and post-order).
- **Customizable:** Users can easily customize the tree structure by providing their own comparison functions or node handling logic.
- **Header-Only:** The implementation is header-only, making it easy to integrate into existing projects.

## Getting Started

To use this tree data structure in your C++ project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tree-data-structure-cpp.git
   ```

2. **Include the Header File:**
   ```cpp
   #include "tree.h"
   ```

3. **Compile your Project:**
   Ensure that the `tree.h` file is included in your compilation process.

## Usage

1. **Create a Tree:**
   ```cpp
   Tree<int> myTree;
   ```

2. **Insert Nodes:**
   ```cpp
   myTree.insert(5);
   myTree.insert(3);
   myTree.insert(7);
   // Add more nodes as needed
   ```

3. **Traverse the Tree:**
   ```cpp
   myTree.preOrderTraversal();
   myTree.inOrderTraversal();
   myTree.postOrderTraversal();
   ```

4. **Customize as Needed:**
   You can customize the tree behavior by providing your own comparison functions or by extending the `TreeNode` class.

## Examples

See the `examples` directory for sample usage of the tree data structure.

```bash
cd examples
g++ basic_example.cpp -o basic_example
./basic_example
```
